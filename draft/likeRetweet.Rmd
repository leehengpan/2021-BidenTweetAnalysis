This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
load(file = "biden_tweets_df.rda")
library(tibble)
df <- as_tibble(biden_tweets_df)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
favorite <- df%>%
  select(text, favoriteCount) %>%
  arrange(desc(favoriteCount)) %>%
  top_n(10)

favorite
```

```{r}
retweet <- df%>%
  select(text, retweetCount) %>%
  arrange(desc(retweetCount)) %>%
  top_n(10)

retweet
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
